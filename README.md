# Usage

## Testing Examples

1 - Build the nodes by running ``.\gradlew clean deployNodes`` from project root directory.\
2 - Run the nodes using ``.\runnodes.bat`` from build\nodes directory. (For Linux : ./runnodes)\
3 - After some time, a window for each node should be ready, you can start flows and query the vault...\
	- Creating a Bank Balance for the 2 banks from Central Bank node:\
		``start com.octo.flows.CreateBankStateFlow bank: "BankA", amount: 10000``\
		``start com.octo.flows.CreateBankStateFlow bank: "BankB", amount: 5000``\
	- Query to see if states are added (from Central Bank, BankA or BankB nodes):\
		 ``run vaultQuery contractStateType: com.octo.states.BankBalanceState``\
	- Make transfer from one bank to another (Example from BankA node to BankB):\
		``start com.octo.flows.TransferMoneyFlow otherBank: "BankB", amount: 5000``
		
## Running tests inside IntelliJ
	
We recommend editing your IntelliJ preferences so that you use the Gradle runner - this means that the quasar utils
plugin will make sure that some flags (like ``-javaagent`` - see below) are
set for you.

To switch to using the Gradle runner:

* Navigate to ``Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner`` (or search for `runner`)
  * Windows: this is in "Settings"
  * MacOS: this is in "Preferences"
* Set "Delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle" to true
* Set "Run test using:" to "Gradle Test Runner"

If you would prefer to use the built in IntelliJ JUnit test runner, you can run ``gradlew installQuasar`` which will
copy your quasar JAR file to the lib directory. You will then need to specify ``-javaagent:lib/quasar.jar``
and set the run directory to the project root directory for each test.

		
## Interacting with the nodes

### Shell

When started via the command line, each node will display an interactive shell:

    Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
    Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.
    
    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>>

You can use this shell to interact with your node. For example, enter `run networkMapSnapshot` to see a list of 
the other nodes on the network:

    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>> run networkMapSnapshot
    [
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10002" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=Notary, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505484825
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10005" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyA, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505382560
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10008" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyB, L=New York, C=US" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505384742
    }
    ]

You can find out more about the node shell [here](https://docs.corda.net/shell.html).

### Client

`clients/src/main/java/com/template/Client.java` defines a simple command-line client that connects to a node via RPC 
and prints a list of the other nodes on the network.

#### Running the client

##### Via the command line

Run the `runTemplateClient` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Template Client` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`.

### Webserver

`clients/src/main/java/com/template/webserver/` defines a simple Spring webserver that connects to a node via RPC and 
allows you to interact with the node over HTTP.

The API endpoints are defined here:

     clients/src/main/java/com/template/webserver/Controller.java

And a static webpage is defined here:

     clients/src/main/resources/static/

#### Running the webserver

##### Via the command line

Run the `runTemplateServer` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Template Server` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

#### Interacting with the webserver

The static webpage is served on:

    http://localhost:10050

While the sole template endpoint is served on:

    http://localhost:10050/templateendpoint
